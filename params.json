  "body": "Duplicati is a backup client that securely stores encrypted, incremental, compressed backups on cloud storage services and remote file servers. It works with Amazon S3, Windows Live SkyDrive, Google Drive (Google Docs), Rackspace Cloud Files or WebDAV, SSH, FTP (and many more). Duplicati is open source and free.\r\n\r\nDuplicati has built-in AES-256 encryption and backups can be signed using GNU Privacy Guard. A built-in scheduler makes sure that backups are always up-to-date. Last but not least, Duplicati provides various options and tweaks like filters, deletion rules, transfer and bandwidth options to run backups for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nDuplicati is licensed under LGPL and available for Windows and Linux (.NET 2.0+ or Mono required). The Duplicati project was inspired by duplicity. Duplicati and duplicity are similar but not compatible. Duplicati is available in English, Spanish, French, German, Danish, Portugese, Italian, and Chinese.\r\n### Duplicati Features\r\n\r\nDuplicati uses AES-256 encryption (or GNU Privacy Guard) to secure all data before it is uploaded.\r\nDuplicati uploads a full backup initially and stores smaller, incremental updates afterwards to save bandwidth and storage space.\r\nA scheduler keeps backups up-to-date automatically.\r\nEncrypted backup files are transferred to targets like FTP, Cloudfiles, WebDAV, SSH (SFTP), Amazon S3 and others.\r\nDuplicati allows backups of folders, document types like e.g. documents or images, or custom filter rules. \r\nDuplicati is available as application with an easy-to-use user interface and as command line tool.\r\nDuplicati can make proper backups of opened or locked files using the Volume Snapshot Service (VSS) under Windows or the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) under Linux. This allows Duplicati to back up the Microsoft Outlook PST file while Outlook is running.\r\nWhy use Duplicati?\r\n\r\nKeep your data safe, store it far away, update your backup regularly! This is a simple rule but many backup solutions do not achieve that today. But Duplicati does!\r\n\r\nKeep your data safe! Bad guys on the Internet seem to look for interesting data everywhere. But people do not want to see any of their private data revealed anywhere. Duplicati provides strong encryption to make sure that your data looks like garbage to others. With a well chosen password your backup files will be more safe on a public webserver than your unencrypted files at home.\r\n\r\nStore your backup far away! The best backup is useless when it is destroyed together with it's original data. Just assume that a fire destroys your office - would your backup survive? Duplicati stores backups on various remote file servers and it supports incremental backups so that only changed parts need to be transfered. This makes it easy to use a destination far away from the original data.\r\n\r\nBackup regularly! The worst case is that your backup is outdated simply because someone forgot to make a backup at the right time. Duplicati has a built-in scheduler, so that it's easy to have a regular, up-to-date backup. Furthermore, Duplicati uses file compression and is able to store incremental backups to save storage space and bandwidth.",
