## About the Project
Duplicati is a project that is run by volunteers who think that everyone's privacy has to be protected as well as personal data. We are not paranoid about data protection and privacy, but we think that backups to cloud services make sense and backup data on cloud services must be as safe as in my home.


## People behind Duplicati
The Duplicati project was started by **Kenneth Skovhede** in 2008. It started as a port of backup software to Windows, but quickly became a huge rewrite. In 2011 **René Stach** joined the project. Kenneth and René then redesigned Duplicati from scratch and called it Duplicati 2.0. Besides Kenneth and René many people have contributed to Duplicati. Some have committed source code, some have tested and reported issues, other have donated some money.
