  <h2 class="post-title">Small backup size.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati compresses all data and it performs incremental backups to minimize the amount of data that is transferred and stored remotely. Duplicati even has built-in deduplication. It detects similar and identical files and stores the same pieces of data only once.</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Built for online.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati was designed for online backups from scratch. It is not only data efficient but also handles network issues nicely. E.g. interrupted backups can be resumed and Duplicati tests the content of backups regularly. That way broken backups on corrupt storage systems can be detected before it’s too late.</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
<h2 class="post-title">Meta data.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati stores the meta data of files and folders on different platforms. This includes dates “last modified, created” as well as attributes like “hidden, archive”. Also access permissions (ACL, POSIX) are stored.</p>
  </div>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Strong encryption.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati uses strong AES-256 encryption to protect your privacy. You can also use GPG to encrypt your backup.</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Trust No One design.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati was developed following the trust-no-one principle. With Duplicati your backup password never leaves your computer. The backup itself does not contain any unencrypted data. And Duplicati’s source code is public so that everyone can review and improve it.</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Many backends.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati works with standard Internet protocols like FTP, SSH, WebDAV as well as popular services like Microsoft OneDrive, Amazon Cloud Drive & S3, Google Drive, box.com, Mega, hubiC and many others.</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Web-based user interface.</h2>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Duplicati is configured by a web interface that runs in any browser (even mobile) and can be accessed - if you like - from anywhere. This also allows to run Duplicati on headless machines like a NAS (network attached storage).</p>
</div>

<div class="tile">
  <h2 class="post-title">Multi-core and performance.</h2>
